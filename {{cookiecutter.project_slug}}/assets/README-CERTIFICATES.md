# Example Certificate File

This is a placeholder file to demonstrate the certificate structure.
Replace this file with your actual certificate files.

Example certificate filenames:
- company-root-ca.crt
- intermediate-ca.pem  
- custom-certificate.cer

The certificate installation process will copy all .crt, .pem, and .cer files
from this directory into Docker images that have certificate installation enabled.
